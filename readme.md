<h1>Desk and Parking Reservation Server Application</h1>
At the core of the Desk and Parking Reservation system lies its server application, a robust and efficient backend designed to power the seamless operation of desk and parking spot reservations at the workplace. Transitioning from an initial Node.js implementation to PHP, the server application offers enhanced flexibility, reliability, and scalability, ensuring smooth management of reservations, user interactions, and administrative tasks.

<h3>Server Features</h3>
<b>Efficient Reservation Management</b>: The server application processes reservations, modifications, and cancellations of desk and parking spots with precision, handling concurrent bookings and ensuring real-time updates across the user interface.

<b>QR Code Integration</b>: A standout feature is the ability to generate and manage QR codes for desk reservations. This functionality supports on-the-go bookings, enabling users to secure a workspace with just a scan from their mobile devices.

<b>Administrative Control Panel</b>: Through the server application, administrators gain access to a comprehensive dashboard for managing the entire reservation ecosystem. This includes user management, resource allocation, and the ability to view detailed booking analytics.

<b>Enhanced Security Measures</b>: Security is paramount, with the server application implementing robust authentication mechanisms, data encryption, and secure API endpoints to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

<h3>Technology Transition and Rationale</h3>
<b>From Node.js to PHP</b>: Initially developed with Node.js for its non-blocking I/O and event-driven capabilities, the application was later transitioned to PHP to address specific deployment and compatibility challenges. PHP's wide adoption, extensive library support, and ease of integration with various databases and hosting services made it an ideal choice for the server-side rewrite.

<b>Relational Database Integration</b>: Leveraging relational databases, the server application efficiently organizes and manages data related to users, bookings, and resources. This structure facilitates quick queries and updates, essential for the dynamic nature of reservation systems.
